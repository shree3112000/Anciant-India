            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>India is a country in South Asia whose name comes from the Indus River. The name 'Bharata' is used as a
                designation for the country in their constitution referencing the ancient mythological emperor, Bharata,
                whose story is told, in part, in the Indian epic Mahabharata</p>
            <p>According to the writings known as the Puranas (religious/historical texts written down in the 5th
                century CE), Bharata conquered the whole subcontinent of India and ruled the land in peace and harmony.
                The land was, therefore, known as Bharatavarsha (`the subcontinent of Bharata'). Hominid activity in the
                Indian subcontinent stretches back over 250,000 years, and it is, therefore, one of the oldest inhabited
                regions on the planet</p>
            <p>Archaeological excavations have discovered artifacts used by early humans, including stone tools, which
                suggest an extremely early date for human habitation and technology in the area. While the civilizations
                of Mesopotamia and Egypt have long been recognized for their celebrated contributions to civilization,
                India has often been overlooked, especially in the West, though its history and culture is just as rich.
                The Indus Valley Civilization (c. 7000-c. 600 BCE) was among the greatest of the ancient world, covering
                more territory than either Egypt or Mesopotamia and producing an equally vibrant and progressive culture
            </p>
            <P>It is the birthplace of four great world religions - Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism - as well
                as the philosophical school of Charvaka which influenced the development of scientific thought and
                inquiry. The inventions and innovations of the people of ancient India include many aspects of modern
                life taken for granted today including the flush toilet, drainage and sewer systems, public pools,
                mathematics, veterinary science, plastic surgery, board games, yoga and meditation, as well as many
                more.</P>

            <p>Archaeological excavations in the past 50 years have dramatically changed the understanding of India's
                past and, by extension, world history. A 4000-year-old skeleton discovered at Balathal in 2009 provides
                the oldest evidence of leprosy in India. Prior to this find, leprosy was considered a much younger
                disease thought to have been carried from Africa to India at some point and then from India to Europe by
                the army of Alexander the Great following his death in 323 BCE.</p>
            <P>It is now understood that significant human activity was underway in India by the Holocene Period (10,000
                years ago) and that many historical assumptions, based upon earlier work in Egypt and Mesopotamia, need
                to be reviewed and revised. The beginnings of the Vedic tradition in India, still practiced today, can
                now be dated, at least in part, to the indigenous people of ancient sites such as Balathal and their
                interaction and blending with the culture of Aryan migrants who arrived in the region between c. 2000-c.
                1500 BCE, initiating the so-called Vedic Period (c. 1500-c.500 BCE) during which the Hindu scriptures
                known as the Vedas were committed to written form.</P>
